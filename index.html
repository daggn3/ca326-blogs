		This is our first blog entry for CA326. We have secured a 3rd year project supervisor and have decided on a project idea. An online shift work scheduler that is based on our own experiences as shift workers. Donal has been tremendously helpful thus far and we hope he continues to be in the future. It is hard to update these as we are up to our eyes in projects but we are doing well so far.

		Sadly have not been able to update these blogs as the project took a backfoot due to exams and whatnot. But now we are full steam ahead! As We have completed our functional spec this is our first steps to create, what we hope will be a worthwhile service to our users. We began today by breaking down our UI into the various react components. We then broke down the prelimanary work breakdown. We decided one person research our backend approach and the other research the front end and react. This was a nice intorudction and let us hit the ground running.
