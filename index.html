	<h1 class = "title">And so it begins..</h1>

	<p class="first">
		This is our first blog entry for CA326. We have secured a 3rd year project supervisor and have decided on a project idea. An online shift work scheduler that is based on our own experiences as shift workers. Donal has been tremendously helpful thus far and we hope he continues to be in the future. It is hard to update these as we are up to our eyes in projects but we are doing well so far.

	<h1 class="title"> I Guess We Should Start? </h1>

	<p class = "first">
		Sadly have not been able to update these blogs as the project took a backfoot due to exams and whatnot. But now we are full steam ahead! As We have completed our functional spec this is our first steps to create, what we hope will be a worthwhile service to our users. We began today by breaking down our UI into the various react components. We then broke down the prelimanary work breakdown. We decided one person research our backend approach and the other research the front end and react. This was a nice introdction and let us hit the ground running.

	<h1 class="title">Research every Day</h1>
	
	<p class = "first">
		We delved headfirst into research today. We split our workload in two, frontend and backend. Conor spent the day revising course notes on databases, and then pushed to find out more about SQL and NoSQL. He discovered the difference between them and came to the conclusion that a MongoDB database would perfectly suit our needs. I on the other hand learned more about react and how to dynamically change the webpage based on what our user did. So all in all...Things are going nicely.

	<h1 class = "title"> MERN Discovery </h1>

	<p class = "first">
		Since the last post I (Conor) have completed half of MongoDB University's Intro to MongoDB course. This how now given me a very good foundational understanding of how MongoDB databases are created and structured. We have also discovered the modern and seemingly popular MERN structure for full-stack web development which is a structure we will most likely be using for this project. Each letter of MERN stands for a different language / technology. M for MongoDB, E for Express js, R for React js and N for Node js. React will obviously handle our front end, MongoDB will be our database and a combination of Node js and Express js will handle our backend.

	<h1 class = "title"> Strides Taken </h1>

	<p class = "first">
		Progess is being made! Niall has begun to work on our frontend and its accompanying logic. Material-ui (a javascript framework) is being utilised to create a cohesive user experience. A login page has been created and also the beginnings of our standard homepage. Our next big step is to add functionality to our homepage to allow users to create, edit and delete events as they see fit. It is really motivational to see progress within our project and this will hopefully allow us to continue at this pace.

	<h1 class = "title"> We are Rolling Now </h1>

	<p class = "first">
		Our app is really coming along now. The structural and stylistic elements of our app are fundementally done along with all the pages needed. I have created a login and sign in page, our main calander page and employee page to allow for creation and listing of employees. On the backend, Conor has created the required schemas to create and maintain our accounts. The next step is to tie these two ends together with our API to handle the requests. I am very happy with our progress thus far and look forward to continuing these efforts. Exciting times indeed.

	<h1 class = "title"> Are we App Developers? </h1>

	<p class = "first">
		Sorry this one was a bit late, a long weekend! We are making great progress. I have swapped the local storage solutions i was using as a stop gap out for actual API calls with axios to our backend that conor created. We now have the capabilities to sign up new users, and for them to create and display employees within our react app. It is very rewarding to see our work paying off. Our next big challenges are to make sure people can log in properly, and also wrangle our calander component with real data.

	<h1 class = "title"> Tiny update </h1>

	<p class = "first">
		 Just a small update. Conor is working hard on wrangling tokens into our backend, and i have made a quick solution for logins, where if there is no account associated with an email and password, it will fail and a popup will inform the user of this. If there is an account associated, they will be redirected to the home page.
